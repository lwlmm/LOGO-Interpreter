@I've written a function called myAlert to report errors

@Program are saved separately into smallest block so that
I can check every block by using turtle->words[blockcounter]
and return line number by using turtle->linecounter

@Since this is an interpretor, each grammar test can only
Synchronize with program operation. There's no big function 
testParser(). only something like numberChecker() or loopCheck()

@I strictly follow the steps required by the question to write 
the program, so parser.c and testInterpretor.c and the corresponding 
.h files are not very complete, which shows the evolution of my program

@Most routine grammar tests are finished in the simplified parser and 
other complex tests like loop or polish check are in extension program
